# Kaggle Project Sharing

## I. Introduction
Here is the sharing of kaalge project. Each project will be classified according to the **technology used** or the **problems faced**.  
You can find projects you want in `By Problem` and `By Technology`.  
Furthermore, you can find some methods and skills of Feature Engineering and Data Processing in `Feature Engineering`
